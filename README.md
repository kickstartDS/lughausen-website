# kickstartDS Storyblok starter



1. Clone our Starter space by visiting https://app.storyblok.com/#!/build/242426.
2. Clone `energyui-storyblok-starter`-Repo by clicking on "Use this template"
   -> "Create new repository".
3. Go to Vercel and click on "Add New..." -> "Project". Import your cloned
   Github Repository. Unfold "Environment Variables" and add the following:
   - `NPM_RC` with `//<your package registry>:_authToken=<your npm token>`
   - `STORYBLOK_API_TOKEN` with a preview token from the cloned Stroyblok
     Space above.
4. Click on "Deploy"
5. Configure your freshly deployt App as the default preview URL in Storyblok
   ("Settings" -> "Visual Editor"). Type in the base URL of your deployment and
   add `/preview/` as the path, e.g.
   `https://energyui-storyblok-starter.vercel.app/preview/`.

See ["Local Development"-Section](#local-development) below for the necessary steps to start developing locally with rapid feedback cycles.

You can use this button to deploy the EnergyUI@Storyblok starter repo on Vercel. Feel free to change the repository URL for quicker deployment of the clone repository:

## Local Development

### Dependencies

- [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation)
- `npm` (unless you opt for devcontainer)

### Setup

#### Locally

1. Copy `.env.local.sample` to `.env.local`. Replace all placeholders with your
   specific configuration and adapt to your needs.
2. If your design system npm package is published on a protected registry,
   please configure the auth token in your `~/.npmrc`.
3. Run a Next.js server process locally:
   1. `npm i`
   2. `npm run dev`
4. Setup a local proxy server for ssl: (in a new terminal)
   1. `mkcert localhost`
   2. `npx local-ssl-proxy --source 3010 --target 3000 --cert localhost.pem --key localhost-key.pem`
5. In storyblok change the preview URL to "Dev".
6. Run `storyblok login` for being able to use the storyblok-cli.

### Creating branded component and preset previews

`YOUR_WEBSITE` should be the path pointing to your website project, the one you want to update the previews for.

1. Clone the Design System this is based on locally: https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-agency
2. Switch to the freshly cloned directory, and inside (ensure you're using the correct Node version 18+; `nvs use`, `nvm use` for automatic selection, if you use one of those tools):
   1. `yarn` to install dependencies
   2. `rm -rf src/token` to remove the existing default theme
   3. `cp -r YOUR_WEBSITE/token src/token` to copy your Design Token / Style Dictionary configuration to the Design System project
   4. Adjust the `background-color` for the `.preview--wrapper` CSS class in `global.scss`, to a color suitable for your component screenshots (depends on your applied design)
   5. `yarn build-storybook` to build a Storybook that can then be used to create screenshots
   6. `yarn create-component-previews` to re-create the existing previews with your branding
   7. `mkdir -p YOUR_WEBSITE/public/img && rm -rf YOUR_WEBSITE/public/img/screenshots && cp -r static/img/screenshots YOUR_WEBSITE/public/img/` to copy the generated screenshots to your project
   8. `cd YOUR_WEBSITE` to switch to your website project
   9. `npm run update-previews` to update those newly created screenshots in your Storyblok space
3. That's it!

## Working with the content schema

### Typescript Support

Generate ts types according to the content schema by running
`NEXT_STORYBLOK_SPACE_ID=<your-space-id> npm run generate-content-types`.

### Migrations

When changing the content schema we recommend sticking to [Storyblok's Best
Practices](https://www.storyblok.com/tp/storyblok-cli-best-practices#modify-blok-structure).
